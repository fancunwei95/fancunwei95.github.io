There are some notes I have taken in my studying path. Some of them are merely lecture notes without any organizations. I will continue to make posts as I learn more and more.


### Statistics

- [Lecture notes taken in "mathematical statistics" (stat 510)]({{ site.url }}/assets/stats510.pdf)
- [Lecture notes taken in "advanced stochastic processes" (stat 533)]({{ site.url }}/assets/stats533.pdf)
- [Lecture notes taken in "advanced time series analysis" (stat 556)]({{ site.url }}/stats556/)
- Solutions to *Stochastic Processes (Sheldon Ross)* (working on it)

### Physics

- Solutions to *Gravitation (Misner, Thorne, Wheeler)*  (working on it)
- Solutions to *Spacetime and Geometry* (working on it)
- Solutions to *Quantum Field Thoery (Peskin, Schroeder)* (working on it)

### Mathematics

- Solutions to *Geometry, Topology and Physics* (working on it)
- Solutions to *Probability: Theory and Examples (Durett)* (working on it)
- Solutions to *Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and Representations (Brian Hall)* (working on it)
