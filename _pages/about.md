I am a physics graduate student at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I come from China and have been in Urbana for several years. During the years, I have tried various fields in physics, from computational physics to theoretical string theory and finally landing in high energy experiment. Below lists my experience and a pdf version of my resume is [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/resume.pdf).

As a physics student, I am interested in solving problems via modeling. Physicists tend to model nature by adding interaction terms in Lagrangian. Another interesting way is to use statistical modeling via data driven methods. I have been utilizing both methods in my Ph.D. works. I find myself more interested in the latter and want to continue my research in data driven problems in industry.
