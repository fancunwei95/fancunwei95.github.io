## Travel Plan
I have always been dreaming of traveling to Hawaii and enjoy the beach and sunshine. 
This spring break we got cheap tickets and make our plan to there. Since the cost is high, I got two friends sharing hotel and car renting with me. 


### Car Renting and Hotel Booking
We made up our plan around Feburary 20th, and we rent a Car from Expedia the car company is SIXT. I reserved a small SUV but I did not get it because we picked up a little late than the planned time. Thus, **choose pick up time so that you have enough time**. Thisis a very bad experience. We finally pick up a Toyota mini Van with the claimed "discount". We mistakenly purchased the most expensive insurance and it costs us another 400 dollars. The car is not clean. There is some bird shit on the back seat. really bad... But we cannot find other places, we have to bear with it.

My friend booked the hotel. It is [Ramada](https://goo.gl/maps/ccqCRTyWauZGnRX96). It is behind the Hilton Hotel village. It is not far from the beach. However, it takes 15 mins to walk to waikiki beach, a famous beach in Honolulu. Overall, since Honolulu is not large, this hotel location is pretty good and you can basically reach anywhere by foot. But you can barely see the see from the hotel window. Ramada is not expensive and we add 30 bucks per night to add a bed for the little kid and 20 bucks for car parking.

## Start On March 11st, 2022

Our flight is UA219 and the flight duration is around 9 hours. In the morning,
we arrived at the airport around 7:30. We bought some great hotdogs for breakfast and Mcdonald's for lunch in the plane since the free food in plane is not enough. I got somebeautiful photos from my phone for the glaciers in South Dokota, Wyoming and Motana.
